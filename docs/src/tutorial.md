# Tutorial

The tutorials will consist of:

1. Overarching tutorial where we show how to Lotka-Voltera problem from the UDE paper.
2. Extended tutorial 1 where we have a neural-network setting parameters, here it is also worthwhile to consider simulation conditions.
3. Extended tutorial 2 where we have a neural network in the observable function.
