PEtab SciML is a table-based data format for creating training (parameter estimation)
problems for **scientific machine learning (SciML)** models that combine machine learning
and mechanistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) models.

> [!WARNING] **Beta Disclaimer**: this software is under active development and may contain
> bugs or instabilities. The PEtab SciML format is finalised and support for it has been
> implemented in PEtab importers, though not yet released. Documentation and utility
> functions are currently being added.

## Major features

Extending the [PEtab format](https://petab.readthedocs.io) for mechanistic ODE models, PEtab
SciML provides a human readable, reproducible way to specify SciML training problems across
diverse scenarios, in a format directly importable by downstream tools. The main aspects
enabling this are:

- **Flexible hybridization.** Machine learning (ML) and ODE models can be combined in three
  ways: (1) ML within the ODE dynamics (includes **Neural ODEs**), (2) ML in the
  observable/measurement model linking simulations to data, and (3) ML upstream of the ODE,
  mapping high-dimensional inputs (e.g., images) to ODE model parameters.
- **Import across ecosystems.** PEtab SciML problems can be imported into state-of-the-art
  toolboxes for dynamic-model training in Julia
  ([PEtab.jl](https://github.com/sebapersson/PEtab.jl)) and Python/JAX
  ([AMICI](https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI)).
- **Broad support for ML architectures.** A diverse set of ML architectures can be specified
  via an exchangeable PEtab SciML YAML format (supports export from PyTorch modules), or via
  importer-specific libraries (e.g., Lux.jl in PEtab.jl; Equinox in AMICI).
- **Diverse model types.** All model features of the
  [PEtab format](https://petab.readthedocs.io) are supported, like models with partial
  observability, multiple simulation conditions, diverse noise models, and/or events.
- **Efficient training strategies.** With minimal user input, PEtab SciML problems can be
  rewritten at the PEtab abstraction level to be compatible with training strategies such as
  multiple shooting, curriculum learning, and regularization (e.g., of ML outputs).
- **Thoroughly tested.** An extensive test suite ensures importers produce correct and
  consistent output.
- **Linting and helpers.** The PEtab SciML Python library provides a linter and utility
  functions for creating common problem types (e.g., Neural ODEs) and transformations (e.g.,
  rewriting a PEtab problem for multiple-shooting training).

## Installation

The PEtab SciML Python 3 helper library can be installed with:

```bash
# (Optional) for PyTorch import/export support
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Required
pip install petab-sciml
```

or

```bash
# Option 1 with PyTorch import/export support
uv pip install petab-sciml[torch]

# Option 2
uv pip install petab-sciml
```
