PEtab SciML - Scientific Machine Learning Format and Tooling
============================================================

PEtab SciML is a table-based data format for creating training (parameter
estimation) problems for **scientific machine learning (SciML)** models that
combine machine learning and mechanistic ordinary differential equation (ODE)
models.

.. warning::

  **Beta Disclaimer**: this software is under active development and may
  contain bugs or  instabilities. The PEtab SciML format is finalised and
  support for it has been implemented  in PEtab importers, though not yet
  released.  Documentation and utility functions are currently being added.

Main features
-------------

Extending the `PEtab format <https://petab.readthedocs.io/>`_ for mechanistic
ODE models, PEtab SciML provides a human readable, reproducible way to specify
SciML training problems across diverse scenarios, in a format directly
importable by downstream tools. The main features are:

-  **Flexible hybridization.** Machine learning (ML) and ODE models can be
   combined in three ways: (1) ML within the ODE dynamics (includes
   Neural ODEs), (2) ML in the observable/measurement model linking simulations
   to data, and (3) ML upstream of the ODE, mapping high-dimensional inputs
   (e.g., images) to ODE model parameters. See figure above.
-  **Import across ecosystems.** PEtab SciML problems can be imported into
   state-of-the-art toolboxes for dynamic-model training in Julia
   (`PEtab.jl <https://github.com/sebapersson/PEtab.jl>`_) and Python/JAX
   (`AMICI <https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI>`_).
-  **Broad support for ML architectures.** A diverse set of ML architectures
   can be specified via an exchangeable PEtab SciML YAML format (supports
   export from PyTorch modules), or via importer-specific libraries (e.g.,
   Lux.jl in PEtab.jl; Equinox in AMICI).
-  **Diverse model types.** All model features of the
   `PEtab format <https://petab.readthedocs.io/>`_ are supported, like models
   with partial observability, multiple simulation conditions, diverse noise
   models, and/or events.
-  **Efficient training strategies.** With minimal user input, PEtab SciML
   problems can be rewritten at the PEtab abstraction level to be compatible
   with training strategies such as multiple shooting, curriculum learning, and
   regularization (e.g., of ML outputs).
-  **Thoroughly tested.** An extensive test suite ensures importers produce
   correct and consistent output.
-  **Linting and helpers.** The PEtab SciML Python library provides a linter
   and utility functions for creating common problem types (e.g., Neural ODEs)
   and transformations (e.g., rewriting a PEtab problem for multiple-shooting
   training).

Installation
------------

The PEtab SciML Python3 helper library can be installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

   # (Optional) for PyTorch import/export support
   pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

   # Required
   pip install petab-sciml

or

.. code-block:: bash

   # Option 1 with PyTorch import/export support
   uv pip install petab-sciml[torch]

   # Option 2
   uv pip install petab-sciml


How to read the documentation
-----------------------------

If you are new to PEtab SciML, start with the
:doc:`Getting started tutorial <examples/getting_started/getting_started>`.
It is a prerequisite for the How-to guides, which cover different model
scenarios (e.g., Neural ODEs, ML model upstream of the ODE). For a complete
description of all options when defining a SciML problem, see the
:doc:`Format specification <format>`.

Why a SciML data format?
------------------------

There are several technical challenges with training SciML models. Firstly,
coding a correct and performant loss/objective function is non-trivial,
especially for more complex scenarios like models with events/callbacks or
partial observability. Secondly, efficient training requires gradients computed
via automatic differentiation (AD). Although frameworks like JAX, PyTorch and
the Julia SciML ecosystem support AD-compatible code, it can still be
challenging to write performant code. Similarly, porting models between
frameworks to leverage  framework-specific benefits is time-consuming because
each AD backend uses different syntax. As a result, training setups are often
hard-coded to a single framework. This undermines reusability, both for
extending prior work and for creating benchmark collections that can run across
different toolboxes.

PEtab SciML solves these problems by providing a human-writable, tabular,
language-independent specification of the training objective. This further
enables generic importers in different ecosystems (e.g., JAX, Julia SciML) to
generate correct, performant training objectives without ad-hoc, per-project
engineering. Together, this improves exchangeability and overall
reproducibility.
