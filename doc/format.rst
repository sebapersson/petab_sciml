Format Specification
====================

A PEtab SciML problem extends the version 2 PEtab standard to accommodate
hybrid models (SciML problems) that combine machine learning (ML) and
mechanistic components. In PEtab SciML, the only supported ML models are neural
networks (NNs). Three new file types are introduced by the extension:

1. :ref:`Neural Network Files <nn_format>`: Files describing NN models.
2. :ref:`Hybridization Table <hybrid_table>`: Table for assigning NN inputs
   and outputs.
3. :ref:`Array Data Files <hdf5_array>`: HDF5 files for storing NN input data
   and/or parameter values.

PEtab SciML further extends the following standard PEtab files:

1. :ref:`Mapping Table <mapping_table>`: Extended to describe how NN
   inputs, outputs and parameters map to PEtab entities.
2. :ref:`Parameters Table <parameter_table>`: Extended to describe
   nominal values and priors for NN parameters.
3. :ref:`Problem YAML File <YAML_file>`: Extended to include a new
   SciML field for NN models and (optionally) array data.

All other PEtab files remain unchanged. This specification explains the
format for each file that is added or modified by the PEtab SciML
extension.

.. _hybrid_types:

High Level Overview
------------------------------------------

The PEtab SciML specification is designed to keep the mechanistic model, ML
model, and PEtab problem as independent as possible while linking them through
the hybridization and/or condition tables. In this context, mechanistic models
are typically defined using community standards like SBML and are commonly
simulated as systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this
specification, the terms mechanistic model and ODE are used interchangeably.
Essentially, the PEtab SciML approach takes a PEtab problem involving a
mechanistic model and supports the integration of ML inputs and outputs.

PEtab SciML supports two classes of hybrid models:

1. **Pre-initialization hybridization**: The ML model is evaluated during the
   pre-initialization stage of each PEtab experiment (as defined in the
   `PEtab v2 specification <https://petab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2/documentation_data_format.html#initialization-and-parameter-application>`__
   ). This means ML model inputs are constant, and the ML model assigns
   parameter values and/or initial values in the ODE model prior to model
   initialization and simulation.
2. **Simulation hybridization**: ML inputs and outputs are computed dynamically
   over the course of a PEtab experiment (i.e., during simulation). This means
   the ML model appears in the ODE right-hand side (RHS) and/or in observable
   formulas.

A PEtab SciML problem can also include multiple ML models. Aside from ensuring
that models do not conflict (e.g., by sharing the same output), no special
considerations are required. Each additional ML model is included just as it
would be in the single ML model case.

.. _nn_format:

NN Model Format
------------------------------------------

The NN model format is flexible, meaning models can be provided in any format
compatible with the PEtab SciML specification. Additionally, the
``petab_sciml`` library provides a NN model YAML format that can be imported
by tools across various programming languages.

Regardless of format, a NN model must consist of two parts to be compatible
with PEtab SciML:

-  **layers**: Defines the NN layers, each with a unique identifier.
-  **forward**: A forward pass function that, given input arguments, specifies
   the order in which layers are called, applies any activation functions, and
   returns one or several arrays. The forward function can accept more than one
   input argument (``n > 1``), and in the :ref:`mapping table <mapping_table>`,
   the forward function’s
   ``n``\ th input argument (ignoring any potential class arguments such as
   ``self``) is referred to as ``inputArgumentIndex{n-1}``. Similar holds for
   the output. Aside from the NN output values, every component that should be
   visible to other parts of the PEtab SciML problem must be defined elsewhere
   (e.g. in **layers**). If input argument names can be extracted, they are
   considered valid PEtab identifiers provided they satisfy the PEtab
   identifier syntax.

.. _NN_YAML:

NN model YAML format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``petab_sciml`` library provides an NN model YAML format for model
exchange. This format follows PyTorch conventions for layer names and
arguments. The schema is provided as a
:download:`JSON schema <standard/nn_model_schema.json>`, which enables
validation with various third-party tools, and also as a
:download:`YAML-formatted JSON Schema <standard/nn_model_schema.yaml>` for
readability.

.. tip::

   **Use the NN model YAML format for interoperability**. The NN model
   specification format in PEtab SciML is flexible, to ensure all
   architectures can be used. However, where possible, the NN model YAML format
   should be used, to facilitate model exchange.

.. _hdf5_array:

Array data
---------------------------------

The standard PEtab format is unsuitable for incorporating large arrays of
values into an estimation problem. This includes the large datasets used to
train NNs, or the parameter values of wide or deep NNs. Hence, PEtab SciML
supports an HDF5-based file format to store and incorporate array data
efficiently.

Referencing array data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To indicate that a PEtab variable (e.g., NN parameters or an NN input) takes
its values from an array data file, it must be explicitly assigned the reserved
keyword ``array`` in the relevant PEtab table entry.

Semantically, assigning ``array`` is interpreted as a global assignment to an
array variable whose potentially condition-specific values are provided in an
array data file. Therefore, specifying ``array`` is only valid in the
:ref:`hybridization table <hybrid_table>` and the
:ref:`parameter Table <parameter_table>`, where assignments apply across all
PEtab experiments.

Array data file format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Array data must be provided as HDF5. Input data and parameter values may be
stored in a single array data file or split across multiple array data files.
The general structure is:

.. code::

   arrays.hdf5                            # (arbitrary filename)
   ├── metadata                           # [GROUP]
   │   └── pytorch_format                 # [DATASET, BOOL] reserved keyword. Whether arrays can directly be used in PyTorch.
   ├── inputs                             # (optional) [GROUP] reserved keyword
   │   ├── inputId1                       # [GROUP] an input ID, must be a valid PEtab ID
   │   │   ├── conditionId1;conditionId2  # [DATASET, FLOAT ARRAY] the input data. The name is a semicolon-delimited list of relevant conditions, or "0" for all conditions.
   │   │   ├── conditionId3
   │   │   └── ...
   │   ├── inputId2
   │   │   └── 0                          # Unlike for inputId1, here the condition ID list is "0" to represent all conditions.
   │   └── ...
   └── parameters                    # (optional) [GROUP] reserved keyword
       ├── netId1                    # [GROUP] a NN ID
       │   ├── layerId1              # [GROUP] a layer ID
       │   │   ├── parameterId1      # [DATASET, FLOAT ARRAY] the parameter values
       │   │   └── ...
       │   └── ...
       └── ...

The schema is provided as a
:download:`JSON schema <standard/array_data_schema.json>`. Currently,
validation is only provided via the PEtab SciML library and does not check the
validity of framework-specific IDs (e.g., input, parameter, and layer IDs).

Multi-dimensional arrays can be stored in a variety of ways, e.g. with row- or
column-major order, and with different ordering of the dimensions. If
``pytorch_format`` is set to true, this means the arrays in the file are stored
according to PyTorch defaults, whereas false indicates that some array
operations are first required. For example, the weight matrix of a "Linear"
layer in PyTorch is "out_features x in_features", unlike other frameworks that
may use "in_features x out_features".

Inputs
^^^^^^

The optional ``inputs`` group stores NN input datasets. For a given input ID,
either a single global dataset (used for all PEtab conditions) or multiple
condition-specific datasets may be provided. In the global case, the dataset
name must be ``0`` (string). In the condition-specific case, the dataset name
must be a semicolon-delimited list of the relevant condition IDs. In either
case, a dataset  must be specified for **all initial PEtab conditions** (the
first condition per PEtab experiment).

The required dataset shape depends on the NN model format:

- If the model is provided in the PEtab SciML
  :ref:`NN model YAML format <NN_YAML>`, datasets must follow the PyTorch
  dimension ordering. For example, if the first layer is ``Conv2d``, the input
  should be in ``(C, W, H)`` format.
- For NN models in other framework-specific formats, input datasets must follow
  the dimension ordering of the respective framework.

.. tip::

   Multiple NNs may share the same input array data: Like PEtab parameters, NN
   inputs are global variables. Shared input data for multiple NNs can be
   specified by using the same input ID in each NN.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

The optional ``parameters`` group stores NN parameter datasets in a
hierarchical structure: ``parameters/<netId>/<layerId>/<parameterId>``.
``parameterId`` and required dataset shape depend on the NN model format:

- For NN models in the PEtab SciML :ref:`NN model YAML format <NN_YAML>`,
  ``parameterId`` name and dataset dimension ordering follow PyTorch
  conventions. For example, in a PyTorch ``Linear`` layer, ``parameterId``s
  are ``weight`` and/or ``bias``.
- For NN models in other framework-specific formats, ``parameterId`` and
  datasets shape follow the conventions of the respective framework.

.. _mapping_table:

Mapping Table
---------------------------------------

Each NN is assigned an identifier in the PEtab problem
:ref:`YAML file <YAML_file>`. The NN identifier itself is not a valid PEtab
identifier, to avoid ambiguity about what it refers to (inputs, parameters,
outputs). Consequently, every NN input, parameter, and output referenced in the
PEtab problem must be defined under ``modelEntityId`` and mapped to a PEtab
identifier in ``petabEntityId``.

An exception applies if the NN model format supports extracting names for
inputs to the forward function. If such input names are valid PEtab
identifiers, they may be used directly as NN input IDs (e.g., for assigning
``array`` in the :ref:`hybridization table <hybrid_table>`). However, the only
way to assign the values of a subset of an input is to first map the input
subset to a new PEtab ID in the :ref:`mapping table <mapping_table>`.

For ``petabEntityId``, the same rules as in PEtab v2 apply.

``modelEntityId`` syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The valid ``modelEntityId`` syntax depends on whether it refers to NN
parameters, inputs, or outputs.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

For a NN model with ID ``nnId``, a parameter reference has the form
``nnId.parameters[<layerId>].<arrayId>[<parameterIndex>]``:

- ``<layerId>``: Layer identifier (e.g., ``conv1``).
- ``<arrayId>``: Parameter array name (e.g., ``weight``).
- ``<parameterIndex>``: Index into the parameter array
  (:ref:`Indexing <mapping_table_indexing>`).

NN parameter PEtab identifiers may only be referenced in the parameter table.

Inputs
^^^^^^

For a NN model with ID ``nnId``, an input reference has the form
``nnId.inputs[<inputArgumentIndex>][<inputIndex>]``:

- ``<inputArgumentIndex>``: Input argument index in the NN forward function.
- ``<inputIndex>``: Index into the input argument
  (:ref:`Indexing <mapping_table_indexing>`). Should be omitted if
  ``[<inputIndex>]`` when the input is provided via an array file.

For restrictions on where NN inputs may be assigned values for different
hybridization modes, see :ref:`Hybridization types <hybrid_types>`.

Outputs
^^^^^^^

For a NN model with ID ``nnId``, an output reference has the form
``nnId.outputs[<outputArgumentIndex>][<outputIndex>]``:

- ``<outputArgumentIndex>``: Output argument index in the NN forward function
  (zero-based).
- ``<outputIndex>``: Index into the output argument
  (:ref:`Indexing <mapping_table_indexing>`).

For restrictions on where NN outputs may be assigned for different
hybridization modes, see :ref:`Hybridization types <hybrid_types>`.

.. _mapping_table_indexing:

Indexing
~~~~~~~~

For both NN inputs and outputs, indexing into arrays uses the format
``[i0, i1, ...]`` and depends on the NN model format:

- Models in the PEtab SciML :ref:`NN model YAML format <NN_YAML>` follow
  PyTorch conventions and use zero-based indexing.
- Models in other formats follow the indexing and naming conventions of the
  respective framework.

.. _hybrid_table:

Hybridization Table
--------------------------------------------

The hybridization table assigns NN inputs and outputs across all PEtab
experiments. The hybridization file is expected to be in tab-separated values
format and to have, in any order, the following two columns:

======================= ===============
**targetId**            **targetValue**
======================= ===============
NON_ESTIMATED_ENTITY_ID MATH_EXPRESSION
nn1_input1              p1
nn1_input2              p1
…                       …
======================= ===============

Detailed Field Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``targetId`` [STRING, REQUIRED]: The identifier of
   the non-estimated entity that will be modified. Restrictions depend
   on hybridization type (see pre-initialization and simulation hybridization
   details below).
-  ``targetValue`` [STRING, REQUIRED]: The value or expression that will be
   used to change the target.

Pre-initialization hybridization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pre-initialization hybridization NN model inputs and outputs are constant
targets.

.. _inputs-1:

Inputs
^^^^^^

Valid ``targetValue``\ s for a NN input are:

-  A parameter in the parameter table.
- ``array`` (values are read from an array data file; see
  :ref:`Array data <hdf5_array>`)

.. _outputs-1:

Outputs
^^^^^^^

Valid ``targetId``\ s for a NN output are:

-  A non-estimated model parameter.
-  A species’ initial value (referenced by the species’ ID). In this case, any
   other species initialization is overridden.

Condition-specific inputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NN input variables are valid ``targetId``\ s for the condition table as long
as, following the PEtab standard, they are NON_PARAMETER_TABLE_ID. Similarly,
array inputs can be assigned condition-specific values using the
:ref:`Array data <hdf5_array>` format. In both cases, two restrictions apply.
Firstly, values can only be assigned for initial PEtab conditions (the first
condition per PEtab experiment) because, with pre-initialization hybridization,
the NN model is evaluated prior to model initialization and simulation.
Assignments to non-initial conditions are ignored. Secondly, since the
hybridization table defines assignments for all simulation conditions, any
``targetId`` value in the condition table (or input ID in an array file) cannot
appear in the hybridization table, and vice versa.

NN output variables can also appear in the ``targetValue`` column of the
condition table.

Simulation hybridization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simulation hybridization NN models can depend on time-varying ODE model
quantities.

.. _inputs-2:

Inputs
^^^^^^

A valid ``targetValue`` for an NN input is:

-  An expression depending on model species, time, and/or parameters. Species
   and parameter references are evaluated at the current simulation time.
-  ``array`` (values are read from an array data file; see
   :ref:`Array data <hdf5_array>`). If PEtab condition-specific values are
   provided, the input is updated following the semantics of the PEtab
   standard, implying input values may change during a PEtab experiment.

.. _outputs-2:

Outputs
^^^^^^^

A valid ``targetId`` for a NN output is a model parameter. During PEtab problem
import, any assigned parameters are replaced by the NN output in the ODE RHS.

.. _parameter_table:

Parameter Table
-------------------------------------------

The parameter table follows the same format as in PEtab v2, with a subset of
fields extended to accommodate NN parameters. This section focuses on columns
extended by the SciML extension.

.. note::

   **Specific Assignments Have Precedence**: More specific assignments (e.g.,
   ``nnId.parameters[layerId]`` instead of ``nnId.parameters``) have precedence
   for nominal values, priors, and other settings. For example, if a nominal
   values is assigned to ``nnId.parameters`` and a different nominal value is
   assigned to ``nnId.parameters[layerId]``, the latter is used.

.. _detailed-field-description-1:

Detailed Field Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``parameterId`` [String, REQUIRED]: The NN or a specific layer/parameter
   array id. The target of the ``parameterId`` must be assigned via the
   :ref:`mapping table <mapping_table>`.

-  ``nominalValue`` [``array`` \| NUMERIC, REQUIRED]: Nominal values for NN
   parameters. If ``estimate = true``, this field can be empty. If
   ``estimate = false``, a nominal value must be provided. Valid values are:

   -  ``array``, in which case values are taken from an existing
      :ref:`array file <hdf5_array>`.
   -  A numeric value applied to all values under ``parameterId``. If values
      are also provided via an :ref:`array file <hdf5_array>`, the array file
      is ignored.

-  ``estimate`` [``false`` \| ``true``, REQUIRED]: Indicates whether the
   parameters are estimated (``true``) or fixed (``false``). Setting ``false``
   for a NN identifier (e.g., ``nnId.parameters[layerId]``) freezes the
   parameters for the identifier.

Bounds for NN parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter bounds can be specified for an entire NN or for nested NN
identifiers. For NN parameters, unbounded estimation is common. Therefore, for
NN parameters ``lowerBound`` and ``upperBound`` can be set to ``-inf`` and
``inf`` respectively, which following the PEtab standard is invalid for other
PEtab parameters. The bounds fields may also be left empty, in which case they
default to ``-inf`` and ``inf``.

Priors for NN parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Priors following the standard PEtab syntax can be specified for an entire NN
or for nested NN identifiers. The prior is duplicated for each value under the
specified identifier, it does not specify a joint prior.

In PEtab v2, if any parameter is assigned a prior, all parameters with
unassigned priors are implicitly assigned a ``uniform(lowerBound, upperBound)``
prior. This also applies to NN parameters. In this case, NN parameters must
have finite ``lowerBound`` and ``upperBound`` so that the prior distribution is
proper.

.. _YAML_file:

Problem YAML File
---------------------------------------

PEtab SciML files are defined within the ``extensions`` section of a PEtab YAML
file, with subsections for neural network models, hybridization tables, and
array files. The general structure is:

.. code::

   ...
   extensions:
     petab_sciml:
       version: 2.0.0        # see PEtab extensions spec.
       required: true        # see PEtab extensions spec.
       neural_networks:      # (required)
         netId1:
           location: ...     # location of NN model file (string).
           format: ...       # equinox | lux.jl | pytorch | yaml
           pre_initialization: ...       # the hybridization type (bool).
         ...
       hybridization_files:  # (required) list of location of hybridization table files
         - ...
         - ...
       array_files:          # list of location of array HDF5 files
         - ...
         - ...


The location fields (``location``, ``hybridization_files``, ``array_files``)
within this ``petab_sciml`` extension section are the same format as other
location fields in a PEtab v2 problem YAML file.

The ``neural_networks`` section is required and must define the following:

-  The keys (e.g. ``netId1`` in the example above) are the NN model IDs.
-  ``format`` [STRING, REQUIRED]: The format that the NN model is provided in.
   This should be a format supported by one of the frameworks that currently
   implement the PEtab SciML standard. Note that the ``equinox`` and ``lux.jl``
   formats are not file formats; rather, they indicate that the NN model is
   specified in a programming language with the respective package.

   -  ``equinox``: the file contains an NN model specified in a Python file as
      a subclass of ``equinox.Module`` (see
      `Equinox documentation <https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/>`__).
      The subclass name must be the NN model ID.
   -  ``lux.jl``: the file contains an NN model specified in a Julia file as a
      Lux.jl function
      (see `Lux.jl documentation <https://lux.csail.mit.edu/stable/>`__).
      The function name must be the NN model ID.
   -  ``pytorch``: the file contains an NN model specified in a Python file as
      a subclass of ``torch.nn.Module`` (see
      `PyTorch documentation <https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/buildmodel_tutorial.html#define-the-class>`__).
      The subclass name must be the NN model ID.
   -  ``yaml``: the file contains an NN model specified in the PEtab SciML NN
      model YAML format (see :ref:`NN model YAML format <NN_YAML>`).

-  ``pre_initialization`` [BOOL, REQUIRED]: The hybridization type
   (see :ref:`hybridization types <hybrid_types>`). ``true`` indicates
   pre-initialization hybridization; ``false`` indicates simulation
   hybridization.

Notes for developers
--------------------

This section outlines recommendations and tips for developers interested in
adding PEtab SciML support to their packages.

Alternative model and neural-network formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both the ODE model and NN formats are flexible. Still, the most widely
supported model format is `SBML <https://sbml.org/>`_, the de facto standard
for dynamical models in computational biology (field of standard developers).
We recommend supporting SBML whenever possible to promote model exchange.
Likewise, we recommend supporting the PEtab SciML NN
:ref:`YAML format <NN_YAML>`.

That said, alternative model formats (e.g.,
`BioNetGen <https://bionetgen.org/>`_) or language-specific formulations, and
alternative NN formats (e.g., architectures not yet covered by the YAML
format), may suit some tools, especially outside biology. The PEtab SciML
standard remains useful across formats by providing a high-level abstraction
that connects the dynamical model and NN components regardless of
representation. For example, leveraging this abstraction,
`PEtab.jl <https://github.com/sebapersson/PEtab.jl/>`_ provides a Julia
interface to create the PEtab tables and can accept a
`DifferentialEquations.jl <https://diffeq.sciml.ai/>`_ ``ODEProblem`` as the
model together with NNs defined in `Lux.jl <https://lux.csail.mit.edu/>`_. If
adding support for other formats, to **thoroughly test correctness**, the PEtab
SciML `test suite <https://github.com/PEtab-dev/petab_sciml_testsuite>`_ can be
adapted by replacing the NN and/or model files to match the formats any
importer targets.

Dealing with arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For array handling, it is recommended to:

- **Respect memory layout and dimension ordering.**
  For computational efficiency, reorder input data and layer-parameter datasets
  to the target language’s native memory layout and dimension ordering when
  importing PEtab SciML problems. For example, PEtab.jl permutes image inputs
  to Julia’s ``(H, W, C)``convention instead of using the PyTorch
  ``(C, H, W)`` ordering.

- **Support exporting parameters to the array format with PyTorch array conventions.**
  One difference between frameworks is how they store arrays. For example,
  PyTorch may use a weight matrix with shape "out_features x in_features",
  whereas another framework may use "in_features x out_features". For
  portability, export arrays to the array format according to PyTorch default
  arrays and set ``pytorch_format`` to true.
